# Implementation Status

## Milestone F0 — Foundation bootstrap

Started after explicit authorization on 2026-09-08.

Implemented:

- isolated engine repository structure;
- C++20 and CMake baseline;
- strict warning policy;
- core numeric aliases;
- UUIDv4 and strong `AssetId`, `EntityId`, `FrameId`, and `WorldId` types;
- fixed-step scheduler primitive with catch-up limits and dropped-time reporting;
- thread-safe logger with replaceable sinks;
- host smoke executable;
- dependency-free core test executable.

Local development prerequisites installed at user scope:

- CMake 4.4.3;
- WinLibs GCC 16.1.0 with MinGW-w64 UCRT and Ninja 1.13.2.

Not implemented:

- SDL3 platform layer;
- Flecs ECS;
- enkiTS jobs;
- Vulkan RHI;
- Jolt Physics;
- asset cooker;
- networking;
- world streaming/reference frames;
- editor;
- game code.

No third-party dependency is introduced in F0. The next milestone should establish the platform/application lifecycle and test infrastructure before importing the ECS, renderer, or physics stack.

## Verification

- CMake configured successfully with GCC 16.1.0 and Ninja.
- All targets compiled with warnings treated as errors.
- `engine_core_tests` passed through CTest.
- `engine_host` launched successfully and scheduled a fixed simulation step.
- Cppcheck warning, performance, and portability checks passed.

## Milestone F1 — Application lifecycle

Implemented:

- platform interface for initialization, shutdown, events, monotonic time, and sleeping;
- headless platform suitable for tests and future dedicated-server work;
- application callbacks for startup, events, fixed updates, rendering, and shutdown;
- bounded fixed-step run loop with render interpolation and optional frame pacing;
- explicit exit reasons and run statistics;
- guaranteed platform and callback shutdown after successful startup, including exception paths;
- deterministic manual-platform lifecycle tests covering frame limits, requested exit, platform quit, startup failure, and exceptions.

The next platform milestone is an SDL3-backed desktop implementation with a real window and input/event translation. It remains behind the same platform interface so tests and dedicated servers do not require SDL.
